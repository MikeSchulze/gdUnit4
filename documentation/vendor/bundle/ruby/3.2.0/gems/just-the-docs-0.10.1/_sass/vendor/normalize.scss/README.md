# normalize.scss

Normalize.scss is an SCSS copy of [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css), a customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.

The [normalize.scss fork](https://github.com/guerrero/normalize.scss) of [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css) was archived in 2014, and has not been updated since v0.1.0.
