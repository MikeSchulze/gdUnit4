# Unit Tests

What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development that involves testing individual components or "units" of your code to ensure they work
as expected in isolation. In game development, a unit typically refers to a small piece of functionality, such as a single function, method, or class.
The goal of unit testing is to verify that each unit of your code performs its intended task correctly and to catch bugs early in the development process.

## Key Characteristics of Unit Testing

* **Isolation:** Each test targets a specific piece of code, independent of other parts of the system.
  This isolation helps identify which component is responsible for any given issue.
* **Automated:** Unit tests are usually automated, allowing developers to run them frequently, quickly, and consistently.
  This automation is especially useful for catching regressions after changes are made to the codebase.
* **Fast and Focused:** Unit tests should be small and fast to execute, focusing on a single "unit" of functionality.
  This makes them ideal for verifying specific behaviors, such as a character’s movement logic or a function that calculates in-game scores.

## Benefits of Unit Testing

* **Early Bug Detection:** By testing individual components, you can detect and fix bugs early in the development cycle before they affect
  other parts of your game.
  Improved Code Quality:** Writing unit tests encourages developers to write modular, maintainable, and well-documented code.
  It also helps ensure that each unit of functionality behaves as intended.
* **Refactoring Confidence:** Unit tests act as a safety net when refactoring or optimizing code.
  If all tests pass after changes are made, you can be confident that your updates haven’t introduced new bugs.
* **Documentation:** Unit tests serve as a form of documentation by demonstrating how specific functions or classes are intended to be used,
  making it easier for other developers to understand the codebase.

## Writing Unit Tests in Game Development

In the context of game development, unit tests can be used to verify:

* **Game Logic:** Testing rules and mechanics, such as character health calculations, score updates, or level progression.
* **Math Functions:** Verifying mathematical calculations, such as physics equations or vector operations.
* **Utility Functions:** Testing helper functions that perform operations like data parsing, string manipulation, or AI decision-making.
* **State Management:** Ensuring that game states (e.g., paused, active, game-over) transition correctly and behave as expected.
