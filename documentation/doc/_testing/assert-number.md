## NumberAssert Examples

### IsEqual

Verifies that the current value is equal to the given one.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsEqual(<expected>)
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(23).IsEqual(23);

// this assertion fails because 23 are not equal to 42
AssertThat(23).IsEqual(42);
```

### IsNotEqual

Verifies that the current value is not equal to the given one.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsNotEqual(<expected>)
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(23).IsNotEqual(42);

// this assertion fails because 23 are equal to 23 
AssertThat(23).IsNotEqual(23);
```

### IsEqualApprox

Verifies that the current and expected value are approximately equal.

```cs
public static INumberAssert<double> AssertThat(<current>).IsEqualApprox(<expected>, <approx>)
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(23.19).IsEqualApprox(23.2, 0.01);
AssertThat(23.20).IsEqualApprox(23.2, 0.01);
AssertThat(23.21).IsEqualApprox(23.2, 0.01);

// this assertion fails because 23.18 and 23.22 are not equal approximately to 23.2 +/- 0.01
AssertThat(23.18).IsEqualApprox(23.2, 0.01);
AssertThat(23.22).IsEqualApprox(23.2, 0.01);
```

### IsLess

Verifies that the current value is less than the given one.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsLess(<expected>)
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(23).IsLess(42);
AssertThat(23).IsLess(24);

// this assertion fails because 23 is not less than 23
AssertThat(23).IsLess(23);
```

### IsLessEqual

Verifies that the current value is less than or equal the given one.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsLessEqual(<expected>)
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(23).IsLessEqual(42);
AssertThat(23).IsLessEqual(23);

// this assertion fails because 23 is not less than or equal to 22
AssertThat(23).IsLessEqual(22);
```

### IsGreater

Verifies that the current value is greater than the given one.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsGreater(<expected>)
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(23).IsGreater(20);
AssertThat(23).IsGreater(22);

// this assertion fails because 23 is not greater than 23
AssertThat(23).IsGreater(23);
```

### IsGreaterEqual

Verifies that the current value is greater than or equal the given one.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsGreaterEqual(<expected>)
```
```cs
AssertThat(23).IsGreaterEqual(20)
AssertThat(23).IsGreaterEqual(23)

// this assertion fails because 23 is not greater than 23
AssertThat(23).IsGreaterEqual(24)
```

### IsEven

Verifies that the current value is even.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsEven()
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(12).IsEven();

// this assertion fail because the value '13' is not even
AssertThat(13).IsEven();
```

### IsOdd

Verifies that the current value is odd.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsOdd()
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(13).IsOdd();

// this assertion fail because the value '12' is even
AssertThat(12).IsOdd();
```

### IsNegative

Verifies that the current value is negative.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsNegative()
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(-13).IsNegative();

// this assertion fail because the value '13' is positive
AssertThat(13).IsNegative();
```

### IsNotNegative

Verifies that the current value is not negative.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsNotNegative()
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(13).IsNotNegative();

// this assertion fail because the value '-13' is negative
AssertThat(-13).IsNotNegative();
```

### IsZero

Verifies that the current value is equal to zero.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsZero()
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(0).IsZero();

// this assertion fail because the value is not zero
AssertThat(1).IsZero();
```

### IsNotZero

Verifies that the current value is not equal to zero.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsNotZero()
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(1).IsNotZero();

// this assertion fail because the value is zero
AssertThat(0).IsNotZero();
```

### IsIn

Verifies that the current value is in the given set of values.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsIn([] <expected>)
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(5).IsIn(3, 4, 5, 6);

// this assertion fail because 7 is not in [3, 4, 5, 6]
AssertThat(7).IsIn(3, 4, 5, 6);
```

### IsNotIn

Verifies that the current value is not in the given set of values.

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsNotIn([] <expected>)
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(5).IsNotIn(3, 4, 6, 7);

// this assertion fail because 5 is in [3, 4, 5, 6]
AssertThat(5).IsNotIn(3, 4, 5, 6);
```

### IsBetween

Verifies that the current value is between the given boundaries (inclusive).

```cs
INumberAssert AssertThat(<current>).IsBetween(<from>, <to>)
```
```cs
// this assertion succeeds
AssertThat(23).IsBetween(20, 30);
AssertThat(23).IsBetween(23, 24);

// this assertion fail because the value is zero and not between 1 and 9
AssertThat(0).IsBetween(1, 9);
```
