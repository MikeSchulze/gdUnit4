# Testing Scene Interactions

## Verified 3D Platformer with GdUnit4
In this tutorial, I explain how to use the Scene Runner in GdUnit4 to verify that a character in a 3D platformer can make certain jumps and cannot make others.<br>
This tutorial focuses on how to use Scene Runner, but it may also be helpful if you are just starting to make a 3D platformer in Godot.<br>
